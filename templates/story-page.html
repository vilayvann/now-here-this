          <p>M: Could you, um, just describe what the rock looks like right now?<br />
            L: Well, it’s really empty, there’re all these glass tables and empty swivel chairs and empty desks.<br />
            L: I think that, there’s an interesting thing about being awake in the middle of the night that like, it just feels very disconnected from daytime hours, um, you know it just, it just feels like, I feel like i’m in a different world right now, I don’t feel like what I’m doing right now is connected to what I’ll do, what I did in the daytime yesterday and what I’ll do in the daytime tomorrow.<br />
            [stair/whistling]<br />
            M: What’s your name?<br />
            T: My name’s Tola. Tola. I’ve been here since around 5pm until five am.<br />
            L: So 12 hours now<br />
            T: Yes, so, I think I just wanna lay down at this point I’m pretty tired. Um, what else would you like to know?<br />
            L: Do you often study at night?<br />
            T: Yeah I study at night. I like to be alone while I’m studying at least to kind of think. To think deeply about things. In the daytime there’s always walking around and um talking and chitter chat you’re phone is goin off, everybody’s up.<br />
            M: Um, what have you been thinking deeply about tonight?<br />
            T: ​laugh​ oh my schoolwork, of course, um, also things in terms of the Bible. Sometimes I’ll take a break and uh I’ll read the Bible cause there’s some pretty cool treasures in there.<br />
            M: What what from the Bible spoke to you tonight especially?<br />
            T: Um tonight I think I read about Abraham who um kind of uh was told by God to sacrifice his own son. And um he did he did go ahead and agree with it um so much so that he brought two men including his sons, you know, to the mountain while he told the two guys to kinda stay behind and Isaac asked “well dad, where’s the lamb that we’re gonna sacrifice?” and uh Abraham lied and said “God is gonna provide the lamb that we’re gonna sacrifice” um Isaac, not knowing that Abraham um was actually gonna sacrifice his own son. Um, so with that being said, he finally gets up to the mountain he finally says “look, I got him here God” and God’s like
            “no, nevermind, I just wanted to see if you would do it” ​laughs​ “there’s a lamb right uh there’s a ram right behind you and um in that you have the heart to serve me and you’re loyal, I’m gonna continually bless you.<br />
            [hum]<br />
            So I kind of reflected on that and I saw I mean I wanted to go to Germany, um, on Friday. And my uncle said no. I really wanted to go to Germany because I wanted to go to a Christian conference and I and I thought that this was the will of the lord but I knew that if I went to Germany against the wishes of my uncle I, I might not have a place to stay. So you know, though he said no, I kept saying “I’m going to Germany” but as I planned and planned and planned I realized that my plans weren’t working out anyways so I had to adhere to the fact that my uncle said “you’re not going to Germany” but um, in that I learned from Abraham’s um Abraham’s uh faith knowing that God will provide or he will make a way. So in the same way, I was willing to sacrifice a whole lot. My education, my work possibly, my stability so that I could go to this conference cause I knew that I was going to learn and I knew that god could provide some way cause I’ve been in so many worse situations. So if I didn’t have a place to say I knew that at least I did the will of the Lord.<br />

            [music]<br />
            L: And it’s the dawn now.<br />
            M: What are you gonna do, right now.<br />
            L: I’m gonna go to sleep. Until like noon, cause it’s, it’s a new day but, I am not ready to start it yet.<br />
